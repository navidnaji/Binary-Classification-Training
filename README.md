# Binary-Classification-Training
In this training i used differnet model like kernels(linear, RBF, polynoial), Logestic regression and k-near models to predict binary classification on training data and predict best model for test data with high accuracy. At the end I plot all the models in one figure.
*Training Phase*: The model is trained on labeled data, where each sample has one of the two classes.It learns to recognize patterns that differentiate the two classes.
*Prediction Phase*: After training, the model uses these learned patterns to predict the class of new, unseen data points.
